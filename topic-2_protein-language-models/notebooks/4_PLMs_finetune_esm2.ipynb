Also, note that memory usage for attention during training will scale as `O(batch_size * num_layers * seq_len^2)`, so larger models on long sequences will use quite a lot of memory!

In sequence classification, we classify an entire protein into a category, from a list of two or more possibilities. There's no limit on the number of categories you can use, or the specific problem you choose, as long as it's something the model could in theory infer from the raw protein sequence. To keep things simple for this example, though, let's try classifying proteins by their cellular localization - given their sequence, can we predict if they're going to be found in the cytosol (the fluid inside the cell) or embedded in the cell membrane?"

The categories will just be integers, with 0 representing the first category, 1 representing the second and so on.

We're going to use 0 to indicate residues without any annotated structure, 1 for residues in an alpha helix, and 2 for residues in a beta strand. To build that, we'll start with an array of all 0s, and then fill in values based on the positions that our regex pulls out of the UniProt results.\n",

Note also that UniProt annotates residues starting from 1 (unlike Python, which starts from 0), and region annotations are inclusive (so 1..3 means residues 1, 2 and 3). To turn these into Python slices, we subtract 1 from the start of each annotation, but not the end."
